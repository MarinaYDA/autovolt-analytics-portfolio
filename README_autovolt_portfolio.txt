Autovolt Analytics Portfolio (Synthetic Data)

This folder contains three synthetic datasets designed to mirror real-world data analyst work
around pricing & margin analysis, messy data cleaning, and warranty risk modeling.
All data is fully synthetic and generated with Python/NumPy/Pandas.

Projects:
1. Project 1 – Pricing & Margin Analysis
   - File: project1_pricing_margin_clean.csv
   - Goal: Analyze profitability by vehicle, battery type, region, and service type.
   - Tools: SQL, Excel, Python (pandas, numpy), BI dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).

2. Project 2 – Service Operations Data Quality
   - File: project2_operations_messy_raw.csv
   - Goal: Clean and standardize messy operational data to build reliable dashboards.
   - Tasks: De-duplicate, standardize text fields, parse dates, handle missing data,
     and produce a clean table similar to Project 1.

3. Project 3 – Warranty Risk Modeling
   - File: project3_warranty_risk.csv
   - Goal: Build and validate models to predict battery failure within 1 year and
     identify high-risk segments.
   - Tools: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost), logistic regression, decision trees,
     random forest, gradient boosting, cross-validation, model evaluation.
