Project 2 – Service Operations Messy Data (raw dataset)
File: project2_operations_messy_raw.csv

This is a deliberately messy version of the Project 1 dataset, used to practice data cleaning.

Messiness includes:
- Inconsistent vehicle_brand strings (different casing, spelling, extra spaces).
- job_date stored as strings with multiple formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY).
- Random missing values in vehicle_model, battery_type, and region.
- Duplicate logical jobs (rows copied with new job_id).
Column meanings mirror Project 1; your task is to clean and standardize this into an analysis-ready table.
